# LoadBalancerForSpringCloudUsingRibbon
Modified example from spring documentation.

It's a modified example of the code given in official spring documentation for client side load balancing. Using round robin load balancing, it sends requests to one of 3 servers running on 3 different ports: 8090,9092, and 9999. The user service runs on port 8888.
